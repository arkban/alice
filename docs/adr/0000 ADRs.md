# ADR - Architectural Design Record

ADR's, or Architectural Design Records, are a simple, low effort way to capture architecturally significant decisions.

# Problem

Others have described the problem better than I can:

* [https://adr.github.io/]()
* [https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/architecture-decision-record]()
* [https://cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions.html]()

# Solution

This project will use ADRs!

## File name format

The format is simple `<number> <title>.md`:

* `<number>` - 0-indexed number
* `<title>` - title

## Document format

Very simple, simpler than most:

```markdown
# <title>

# Problem

# Solution

# Consequences
```

One thing that is _intentionally_ not included is any kind of "Status" or "Date" -- if it's committed it's accepted, and
source control will manage the dates.

# Consequences

Hopefully a well-documented code base follows.
